                    <li>You are entitled to have your legitimate objectives respected by your attorney, including whether or not to settle your matter (court approval of a settlement is required in some matters).</li>
                    <li>You have the right to privacy in your dealings with your lawyer and to have your secrets and confidences preserved to the extent permitted by law.</li>
