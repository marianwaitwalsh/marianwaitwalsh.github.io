            <h3>Manage Your Legal Fees and Improve Your Outcome</h3>
            
            <div id="main-text">
                <p>The following simple guidelines will help to both keep your legal fees manageable and improve the outcome of your case:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be honest with your attorney. This means, very simply, tell your attorney “the whole truth and nothing but the truth.”</li>
                    
                    <li>Provide all the information related to your situation, whether or not you think it is relevant. You never know what seemingly insignificant fact can drastically alter the legal results. Let your attorney decide what is relevant. The more information you provide, the sooner, and the more organized it is, the better and the less expensive your outcome.</li>
                    
                    <li>Follow your attorney’s instructions. This should probably be the first guideline because it is so critical. If your attorney tells you not to discuss a particular matter with the other parties, then don’t. If you inadvertently do so, let your attorney know immediately. The sooner your attorney can start the damage control, the better the result.</li>
                    
                    <span class="back-to-top"><a href="#nav-bar">Back to top <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-up"></i></a><br/><br/></span>
                    
                    <li>Gather and record information as soon as something happens that might develop into a lawsuit. If you have been in an accident, or even just witnessed an accident, or have goods damaged from a moving company, or are involved in any event that might result in litigation, or even that you just want to straighten out with someone, write everything down and take pictures if you can. The sooner you do this after the event, the better. Make note of who, what, when, how and where. You may be surprised at how faulty our memories can be within a relatively short time after an event.</li>
                    
                    <li>Be on time. When you meet with your attorney, be on time. Most attorneys will be prepared for you at the time of your appointment. Don’t even think of being late for Court, even if you know you are very likely to have a long wait once you arrive.</li>
                    
                    <li>Keep your attorney informed. As the representation progresses, keep your attorney informed about any new information or developments of which you are aware, including even routine matters such as change of address and a new cell phone number.</li>
                    
                    <li>Choose your attorney wisely. This is important for both you and your attorney. We provide an initial half-hour consultation without charge, and encourage you to try this. This gives both you and us a very good idea about whether and how we can proceed with each other. It is just as important that we are comfortable with you, as it is that you are comfortable with us. This meeting is without any obligation on either side to proceed. This almost always results in free legal advice to you in the process!</li>
